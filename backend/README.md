Project :  **TatkalLink**  
**Slogan:** *"Connecting You to Instant Seats – Fast, Easy, Reliable."*

---

### Why it works:
- **Clear purpose:** The name instantly tells users it’s about Tatkal (last-minute) bookings.
- **"Link"** suggests a platform connecting users with providers (which is exactly what your site does).
- **Professional yet simple** – sounds like a trustworthy service, not shady or overly flashy.
- **Works across modes of transport** (train, bus, etc.) without needing to change later.
- Easy to brand, scale, and even develop into an app.

Nice! 🚀 You're building TatkalLink — a platform to connect users urgently needing Tatkal tickets (for trains, buses, flights, etc.) with providers who can help book or arrange those tickets quickly.

🔍 Project Overview:
TatkalLink is essentially a marketplace + coordination platform with two primary user roles:

Seekers – users who urgently need Tatkal tickets.

Providers – verified individuals or agencies who can help get tickets booked.


User

Role (for RBAC - Role-Based Access Control)

Session / Token

AuditLog (optional but great for production apps)

Product (as an example business model)

Order (example for transactional system)

All models will include:

Timestamps

Type-safe interfaces

Validation
